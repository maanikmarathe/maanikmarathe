# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Maanik.
Currently working towards my M.Sc. in Information Technology in Stuttgart, Germany, I am an engineer with nearly two years of experience in software development and over 1.5 years working as a research assistant in Computational Cognitive Science. After finishing my degree (expected to be around October 2025), I am looking forward to working full-time as a software developer.

## The road so far
- Started out an electronics and instrumentation engineer, but I loved writing code so much that I went into IT.
- Worked as a full-stack software developer from 2020-2022, before moving abroad to Germany for a Master degree at the University of Stuttgart.
- As a research assistant at the university, I worked on the software implementation of an experiment as well as carrying out the study as part of the researcher team.


## Hobbies & Activities

- Music: Playing the piano, singing, and recently teaching myself to play the guitar.
- Reading: Everything from science fiction to productivity and lots in between.
- Language learning and cultural exchange: I have been learning German since 2022 and am always looking for new connections between cultures.
- Dance: I discovered Bal-folk dancing during my time at the University and am also exploring other dance forms like West Coast Swing.

## Highlights and fun facts

- Mentoring: During my full-time software development experience, I took on a large part of the technical onboarding and learning phase of three new members of the team on their journey from joining as interns through to working as full-time developers themselves. I also mentored incoming students at the University to help make their transition to student life smoother.
